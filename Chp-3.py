# Removing an Item Using the pop() Method
# Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a 
# list. For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien that 
# was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web 
# application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members 
# and then add that user to a list of inactive members.
# The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work 
# with that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of a 
# list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In 
# this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.
